### Math 7
How many years will it take for an item growing 20% annually to double?
### Answer
To calculate how long it takes for something to double given a constant rate of growth, you can use the rule of 72. The rule of 72 is a simple way to determine how long an investment will take to double given a fixed annual rate of interest. You divide 72 by the annual rate of return.

If an item is growing at 20% per year, you would divide 72 by 20, which is 3.6. So, it would take approximately 3.6 years for the item to double if it grows at 20% annually.
