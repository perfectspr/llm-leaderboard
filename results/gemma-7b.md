### Knowledge 2
Who was the president in 2003 and why?
### Expected Answer
In 2003, the President of the United States was George W. Bush. He was the 43rd President, serving from January 20, 2001, to January 20, 2009. George W. Bush was elected President in the 2000 election, having previously served as the Governor of Texas. He was then re-elected in the 2004 election for a second term.

The reason why George W. Bush was president in 2003 is simply that he won the 2000 presidential election, securing the majority of electoral votes against his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, in a highly contested election that included a significant dispute over the vote count in Florida. After a series of court challenges, the United States Supreme Court effectively halted the recount in Florida, resulting in Bush winning the state's electoral votes and thus the presidency. Bush was inaugurated as President on January 20, 2001, and served during 2003 as part of his first term in office.
### Received Answer
George W. Bush was the president in 2003. He was elected to a second term after winning the 2000 election.

### Knowledge 6
Explain the role of carbon in biological life, and suggest another element that could serve a similar role.
### Expected Answer
Carbon plays a central role in biological life due to several unique properties:

1. **Versatility in Forming Bonds:** Carbon atoms can form stable covalent bonds with many other elements, including themselves. This ability allows for the creation of complex and diverse organic molecules.

2. **Tetravalency:** A carbon atom has four valence electrons, which means it can form up to four covalent bonds with other atoms. This tetravalency allows carbon to act as an intersection point from which a variety of molecular structures can branch out, including chains, rings, and three-dimensional frameworks.

3. **Formation of Stable and Energy-Rich Molecules:** Carbon-based molecules can store considerable amounts of energy, which is vital for biological processes. For example, the energy stored in the bonds of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins fuels living organisms.

4. **Ability to Form Double and Triple Bonds:** Carbon atoms can form multiple bonds with certain other atoms, including carbon itself, leading to a variety of organic compounds with different properties.

5. **Existence in Different Allotropes:** Carbon exists in several allotropes, such as diamond, graphite, and fullerenes, each with distinct physical properties.

Because of these properties, carbon is the backbone of all known life on Earth, forming the basis for carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and many other organic molecules essential to life.

**Silicon** is often suggested as an alternative element that could potentially support life due to some similarities with carbon:

1. **Tetravalency:** Like carbon, silicon has four valence electrons and can form up to four covalent bonds, making it theoretically capable of forming a variety of complex molecules.

2. **Abundance in Nature:** Silicon is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, providing a vast resource for potential silicon-based life.

However, there are significant differences that make silicon less suitable for life as we know it:

1. **Bond Strength and Stability:** Silicon-silicon and silicon-hydrogen bonds are generally much less stable than their carbon counterparts. Silicon compounds are also more reactive with water.

2. **Less Versatility in Bonding:** Silicon has a larger atomic radius and is less electronegative than carbon, which limits its ability to form multiple bonds and results in bulkier and less diverse molecules.

3. **Biological Reactivity:** Silicon-based molecules are generally less suited to participate in the types of fast and versatile reactions that characterize biological systems.

While silicon-based life is a popular subject in science fiction, we have no evidence of its existence, and carbon remains unparalleled in its ability to form the complex, stable, and diverse molecules required for life as we know it.
### Received Answer
Carbon is a chemical element with the symbol C, atomic number 6, and atomic mass 12.011. It is the fourth most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is essential for life as it plays a key role in the structure and function of living organisms.

**Carbon's Role in Biological Life:**

* **Building Blocks:** Carbon is the backbone of life, as it is the main element used to build the molecules that form living organisms. These molecules include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.
* **Structural Framework:** Carbon atoms are bonded to each other in various ways to form the backbone of many molecules. This structure gives strength and rigidity to molecules, which is essential for the proper functioning of living cells.
* **Functional Groups:** Carbon atoms can participate in various chemical reactions, forming functional groups that give molecules their unique properties. For example, carbon atoms can form covalent bonds with oxygen atoms to form carbonyl groups, which are found in many important molecules such as glucose and fatty acids.
* **Energy Storage:** Carbon is a key component of energy storage molecules such as glucose and glycogen. These molecules store energy in their chemical bonds, which can be released when needed.

**Another Element That Could Serve a Similar Role:**

Silicon is an element that has a similar chemical structure to carbon and is also essential for life. Silicon is the fifth most abundant element in the universe and is found in many biological molecules, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. Silicon is important for life because it helps to form the backbone of molecules and can participate in similar chemical reactions to carbon.

**Conclusion:**

Carbon is an essential element for life, playing a key role in the structure and function of living organisms. Silicon is another element that could serve a similar role, although it is not as abundant in the universe.

### Knowledge 7
Please describe what a snail looks like.
### Expected Answer
A snail is a small, slow-moving mollusk with a soft, unsegmented body. It is most commonly recognized by its prominent shell, which it carries on its back. Here are some key features of a snail:

1. **Shell**: The shell is typically coiled or spiral in shape, offering protection to the snail's delicate body. Shells can vary widely in color and pattern, often reflecting the snail's habitat.

2. **Body**: Beneath the shell, the snail's body is elongated and moist, with a distinct head and foot. The body can be various shades of brown, gray, or nearly transparent, depending on the species.

3. **Head**: The head of the snail includes tentacles, which vary in number depending on the species. Most snails have four tentacles; the longer pair houses the eyes at the tips, while the shorter pair is used for tactile and olfactory sensations.

4. **Foot**: The broad muscular part at the bottom of the snail's body is called the foot. The foot secretes mucus, which facilitates movement as the snail glides along surfaces.

5. **Operculum**: Some species of snails have a hard, plate-like structure called the operculum, which can close off the shell's opening, providing additional protection from predators and harsh environments.

6. **Mantle**: Just inside the shell opening is the mantle, a significant organ that is responsible for secreting the shell's material, allowing it to grow with the snail.

Snails can be found in a variety of environments, including gardens, forests, and bodies of water, both freshwater and marine. Each environment hosts snail species with adaptations suited to their specific habitat.
### Received Answer
Sure, here is a description of what a snail looks like:

A snail is a small invertebrate that has a soft, muscular body and a hard shell. The shell is spiral in shape and is made up of layers of calcium carbonate. The shell is usually brown or gray, but it can also be white, black, or red. The body of the snail is divided into two main parts: the head and the tail. The head has a mouth, a radula (a tongue that is used to scrape food), and eyes. The tail is a long, thin appendage that is used for locomotion. Snails have a spiral shell and a soft, muscular body. They are typically small, ranging in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters.

### Coding 1
Generate a bash script to create 10 files, with the names A1.txt through A10.txt
### Expected Answer
```bash
for i in {1..10}
do
  touch A$i.txt
done
```
### Received Answer
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create 10 files with names A1.txt through A10.txt
for i in {1..10}; do
  touch A$i.txt
done
```

**Explanation:**

* The script starts by defining a `for` loop that iterates over a range of numbers from 1 to 10, inclusive.
* Inside the loop, the variable `i` represents the current number in the range.
* The script uses the `touch` command to create a new file named `A$i.txt` for each value of `i`.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
bash script.sh
```

**Output:**

The script will create 10 files with the following names:

```
A1.txt
A2.txt
A3.txt
...
A10.txt
```

**Note:**

* The script assumes that the `touch` command is available on your system.
* You can modify the script to change the file names or the number of files to create.

### Expected Answer
```python
def area_circle(radius):
    return 3.14 * (radius**2)
```
### Received Answer
```python
import math

def area_of_circle(r):
  """Calculates the area of a circle.

  Args:
    r: The radius of the circle.

  Returns:
    The area of the circle.
  """

  return math.pi * r**2
```

**Usage:**

```python
# Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5.
area = area_of_circle(5)

# Print the area.
print(area)  # Output: 250.0
```

**Explanation:**

* The function `area_of_circle` takes one argument, `r`, which represents the radius of the circle.
* The formula for the area of a circle is given by the formula `πr^2`, where `π` is the constant for the area of a circle and `r` is the radius.
* The `math` module provides a constant `pi` that can be used instead of the value 3.14159.
* The function calculates the area of the circle using the formula and returns the result.

**Note:**

* The function assumes that the input `r` is a positive number.
* The function does not handle negative numbers or complex numbers.
* The function does not check if `r` is a valid radius.

### Coding 6
Write a Python program that prints the value of every tree node value of a binary tree.
### Expected Answer
To print the value of every node in a binary tree, we first need to define the structure of a binary tree. A binary tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

Here's a simple Python program that defines a binary tree node, populates the tree, and prints the values of all nodes using an in-order traversal (which visits left subtree, root, and then right subtree):

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def print_tree_in_order(node):
    if node is not None:
        print_tree_in_order(node.left)
        print(node.value)
        print_tree_in_order(node.right)

# Example usage:
# Constructing the following binary tree
#        1
#       / \
#      2   3
#     / \
#    4   5

root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)

print_tree_in_order(root)
```

When you run this program, it will output:

```
4
2
5
1
3
```

This program uses a recursive function `print_tree_in_order` to traverse the tree in an in-order fashion. If you would like to print the values using a different traversal method, such as pre-order or post-order, you can modify the function as follows:

For pre-order traversal (root, left subtree, right subtree):

```python
def print_tree_pre_order(node):
    if node is not None:
        print(node.value)
        print_tree_pre_order(node.left)
        print_tree_pre_order(node.right)
```

For post-order traversal (left subtree, right subtree, root):

```python
def print_tree_post_order(node):
    if node is not None:
        print_tree_post_order(node.left)
        print_tree_post_order(node.right)
        print(node.value)
```
### Received Answer
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

# Print tree node values
def printTreeValues(node):
    # If the node is not None, print its value
    if node is not None:
        print(node.val)

        # Recursively print the values of the left and right subtrees
        printTreeValues(node.left)
        printTreeValues(node.right)

# Example usage
root = TreeNode(10)
root.left = TreeNode(5)
root.right = TreeNode(15)
root.left.left = TreeNode(2)
root.left.right = TreeNode(7)

printTreeValues(root)
```

**Output:**

```
10
5
2
7
15
```

**Explanation:**

* The `printTreeValues()` function takes a reference to a binary tree node as input.
* If the node is not `None`, it prints the value of the node.
* The function then recursively calls itself on the left and right subtrees of the current node.
* The output of the function is a list of all the node values in the binary tree in order.

**Note:**

* This function will print the values of all nodes in the tree, regardless of their level in the tree.
* The order in which the nodes are printed is the order in which they are visited in a preorder traversal of the tree.
* The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
* The space complexity of this function is O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

### Coding 7
What is the difference between multiprocessing and multithreading in Python?
### Expected Answer
Multiprocessing and multithreading are both approaches to achieve parallelism and concurrency in Python, allowing a program to perform multiple operations at once. However, they work in different ways and are suitable for different types of tasks. Here's a brief overview of the differences:

**Multithreading:**
- Threads are lighter-weight than processes. They share the same memory space and efficiently read and write to the same variables.
- In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. This means that threads are not truly running in parallel in a standard CPython implementation when it comes to CPU-bound tasks. They are better suited for I/O-bound tasks where the performance improvement comes from the program being able to handle I/O operations concurrently.
- Multithreading is useful when the program is I/O-bound and you want to make better use of idle time, such as waiting for files or network services.
- Multithreading can lead to issues like race conditions and deadlocks if not managed correctly, due to shared access to mutable data.

**Multiprocessing:**
- Each process in multiprocessing has its own Python interpreter and memory space, so the GIL does not prevent multiple processes from running in parallel on multiple CPU cores. This makes it suitable for CPU-bound tasks.
- Multiprocessing often results in a higher memory overhead because each process has a separate memory space.
- It is useful for CPU-intensive operations where tasks can be performed in parallel without needing to share data, or where data sharing is done minimally and carefully (using IPC mechanisms like queues or pipes).
- Multiprocessing in Python can be implemented using the `multiprocessing` module, which provides an API similar to `threading`.

In summary, multithreading is best for tasks that spend a lot of time waiting for external events (I/O-bound), while multiprocessing is best for tasks that need to perform a lot of computations and can take advantage of multiple cores (CPU-bound). Each method comes with its own set of challenges and trade-offs, such as managing concurrency issues in multithreading or dealing with the overhead of inter-process communication in multiprocessing.

### Received Answer
**Multiprocessing** and **Multithreading** are two techniques in Python for executing multiple tasks concurrently.

**Multiprocessing:**

* Uses multiple processes, which are separate instances of the Python interpreter.
* Each process has its own memory space and resources.
* Useful for tasks that are memory-bound or involve a lot of I/O operations.
* Can be slower than multithreading for tasks that require a lot of shared data.

**Multithreading:**

* Uses a single process with multiple threads.
* Threads share the same memory space and resources.
* Useful for tasks that are CPU-bound or involve a lot of waiting for external events.
* Can be faster than multiprocessing for tasks that require a lot of shared data.

**Key Differences:**

| Feature | Multiprocessing | Multithreading |
|---|---|---|
| Number of processes | Multiple | Single |
| Memory space | Separate | Shared |
| Resource allocation | Independent | Shared |
| Communication | Between processes | Within a process |
| Synchronization | Easier | More complex |
| Speed | Slower for shared data | Faster for shared data |
| Use cases | Memory-bound tasks, I/O-bound tasks | CPU-bound tasks, waiting events |

**Choosing Between Multiprocessing and Multithreading:**

* Use **multiprocessing** when tasks are memory-bound or involve a lot of I/O operations.
* Use **multithreading** when tasks are CPU-bound or involve a lot of waiting for external events.
* Consider **multithreading** first, as it is generally more efficient than multiprocessing.
* If you need to use shared data between threads, consider using a multiprocessing approach.

**Example:**

* **Multiprocessing:**
```python
import multiprocessing

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

processes = [multiprocessing.Process(target=square, args=(i,)) for i in range(10)]

for process in processes:
    process.start()

results = [process.join() for process in processes]

print(results)
```

* **Multithreading:**
```python
import threading

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

threads = [threading.Thread(target=square, args=(i,)) for i in range(10)]

for thread in threads:
    thread.start()

results = [thread.join() for thread in threads]

print(results)
```

### Math 4
Tom paints a room that has 5 walls. Each wall is 2 meters by 3 meters. John can paint 1 square meter every 10 minutes. He has 10 hours to paint everything. How many hours does he have to spare?
### Expected Answer
Each wall is 2*3=6 square meters So each wall takes 6*10=60 minutes to paint So it takes 60/60=1 hour to paint each wall That means in total it takes 5*1=5 hours to paint So he has 10-5=5 hour left after finishing painting The answer is 5
### Received Answer
**1. Calculate the area of each wall:**

* Area of one wall = 2m * 3m = 6 square meters
* Total area of walls = 5 * 6 = 30 square meters

**2. Calculate the time John can paint one square meter:**

* Time to paint one square meter = 10 minutes

**3. Calculate the total time John can paint:**

* Total time to paint = 30 square meters * 10 minutes per square meter = 300 minutes

**4. Calculate the time spent painting:**

* Time spent painting = 10 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 600 minutes

**5. Calculate the hours available for spare time:**

* Hours available for spare time = 600 minutes - 300 minutes = 300 minutes

Therefore, John has 300 hours of spare time.

### Expected Answer
The 5 students buy 5*1=5 candy bars. The 5 students buy 5*2=10 bags of chips. The 5 candy bars cost 5*2=10 dollars. The 10 bags of chips cost 10*0.5=5 dollars. The students need 10+5=15 dollars. The answer is 15
### Received Answer
Sure, here is the solution:

**1. Calculate the cost of 1 candy bar and 2 bags of chips:**

* 1 candy bar costs $2.00
* 2 bags of chips cost $0.50 x 2 = $1.00

**2. Multiply the number of students by the cost of each student's snack:**

* 5 students will need $2.00 + $1.00 = $3.00

Therefore, a total of $3.00 will be needed for 5 students to purchase 1 candy bar and 2 bags of chips.

### Math 7
How many years will it take for an item growing 20% annually to double?
### Expected Answer
To calculate how long it takes for something to double given a constant rate of growth, you can use the rule of 72. The rule of 72 is a simple way to determine how long an investment will take to double given a fixed annual rate of interest. You divide 72 by the annual rate of return.

If an item is growing at 20% per year, you would divide 72 by 20, which is 3.6. So, it would take approximately 3.6 years for the item to double if it grows at 20% annually.
### Received Answer
The formula to find the number of years it takes for an item to double is:

$$n = \frac{\log(2)  }{ \log(1 + r) }$$

where n is the number of years, r is the annual growth rate, and log is the natural logarithm.

If r = 20%, then:

$$n = \frac{\log(2)  }{ \log(1 + 0.2) } = 5 years$$

Therefore, it will take 5 years for an item growing 20% annually to double.

### Extraction 1
According to below text, how long did the Mughal empire last in India?

The Mughal Empire was an early-modern empire that controlled much of Indian subcontinent between the 16th and 19th centuries. For some two hundred years, the empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus river basin in the west, northern Afghanistan in the northwest, and Kashmir in the north, to the highlands of present-day Assam and Bangladesh in the east, and the uplands of the Deccan Plateau in South India.It included present day areas of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The Mughal empire is conventionally said to have been founded in 1526 by Babur, a warrior chieftain from what is today Uzbekistan, who employed aid from the neighboring Safavid and Ottoman empires, to defeat the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi, in the First Battle of Panipat, and to sweep down the plains of North India. The Mughal imperial structure, however, is sometimes dated to 1600, to the rule of Babur's grandson, Akbar. This imperial structure lasted until 1720, shortly after the death of the last major emperor, Aurangzeb, during whose reign the empire also achieved its maximum geographical extent. Reduced subsequently to the region in and around Old Delhi by 1760, the empire was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Although the Mughal empire was created and sustained by military warfare, it did not vigorously suppress the cultures and peoples it came to rule; rather it equalized and placated them through new administrative practices and diverse ruling elites, leading to more efficient, centralised, and standardized rule. The base of the empire's collective wealth was agricultural taxes, instituted by the third Mughal emperor, Akbar. These taxes, which amounted to well over half the output of a peasant cultivator, were paid in the well-regulated silver currency, and caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion. The burgeoning European presence in the Indian Ocean, and its increasing demand for Indian raw and finished products, created still greater wealth in the Mughal courts. There was more conspicuous consumption among the Mughal elite, resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture, especially during the reign of Shah Jahan. Among the Mughal UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Asia are: Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri, Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, Lahore Fort, Shalamar Gardens, and the Taj Mahal, which is described as "the jewel of Muslim art in India, and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage."
### Expected Answer
The Mughal empire was founded by Babur in 1526 and was dissolved by the British in 1857, a span of 331 years.
### Received Answer
According to the text, the Mughal empire lasted in India for two hundred years, from 1526 to 1720.

They were Pirali Brahmin ('Pirali’ historically carried a stigmatized and pejorative connotation) originally belonged to a village named Kush in the district named Burdwan in West Bengal. The biographer of Rabindranath Tagore, Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyaya wrote in the first volume of his book Rabindrajibani O Rabindra Sahitya Prabeshak that The Kusharis were the descendants of Deen Kushari, the son of Bhatta Narayana; Deen was granted a village named Kush (in Burdwan zilla) by Maharaja Kshitisura, he became its chief and came to be known as Kushari. Life and events Early life: 1861–1878 Main article: Early life of Rabindranath Tagore Young Tagore in London, 1879 The last two days a storm has been raging, similar to the description in my song—Jhauro jhauro borishe baridhara [... amidst it] a hapless, homeless man drenched from top to toe standing on the roof of his steamer [...] the last two days I have been singing this song over and over [...] as a result the pelting sound of the intense rain, the wail of the wind, the sound of the heaving Gorai River, [...] have assumed a fresh life and found a new language and I have felt like a major actor in this new musical drama unfolding before me. — Letter to Indira Devi. The youngest of 13 surviving children, Tagore (nicknamed "Rabi") was born on 7 May 1861 in the Jorasanko mansion in Calcutta, the son of Debendranath Tagore (1817–1905) and Sarada Devi (1830–1875). Black-and-white photograph of a finely dressed man and woman: the man, smiling, stands with the hand on the hip and elbow turned outward with a shawl draped over his shoulders and in Bengali formal wear. In front of him, the woman, seated, is in elaborate dress and shawl; she leans against a carved table supporting a vase and flowing leaves. Tagore and his wife Mrinalini Devi, 1883 Tagore was raised mostly by servants; his mother had died in his early childhood and his father travelled widely. The Tagore family was at the forefront of the Bengal renaissance. They hosted the publication of literary magazines; theatre and recitals of Bengali and Western classical music featured there regularly. Tagore's father invited several professional Dhrupad musicians to stay in the house and teach Indian classical music to the children. Tagore's oldest brother Dwijendranath was a philosopher and poet. Another brother, Satyendranath, was the first Indian appointed to the elite and formerly all-European Indian Civil Service. Yet another brother, Jyotirindranath, was a musician, composer, and playwright. His sister Swarnakumari became a novelist. Jyotirindranath's wife Kadambari Devi, slightly older than Tagore, was a dear friend and powerful influence. Her abrupt suicide in 1884, soon after he married, left him profoundly distraught for years.

### Reasoning 1
I have 2 apples, then I buy 2 more. I bake a pie with 2 of the apples. After eating half of the pie how many apples do I have left?
### Expected Answer
2
### Received Answer
Sure, here is the solution:

**1. Calculate the total number of apples:**
- You have 2 apples.
- You buy 2 more apples, so you have a total of 2 + 2 = 4 apples.

**2. Bake a pie with 2 apples:**
- You use 2 apples to bake a pie, so you have 4 - 2 = 2 apples left.

**3. Eat half of the pie:**
- You eat half of the pie, which is 1 apple, so you have 2 - 1 = 1 apple left.

Therefore, you have a total of 1 apple left after eating half of the pie.

### Reasoning 2
I went to the market and bought 10 apples. I gave 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman. I then went and bought 5 more apples and ate 1. I also gave 3 bananas to my brother. How many apples did I remain with?
### Expected Answer
10
### Received Answer
Here is the calculation:

1. You bought 10 apples, gave 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 apples to the repairman, so you have 10 - 2 - 2 = 6 apples left.
2. You bought 5 more apples, so you have 6 + 5 = 11 apples.
3. You ate 1 apple and gave 3 bananas to your brother, so you have 11 - 1 - 3 = 7 apples left.

Therefore, you have a total of 7 apples remaining.

### Reasoning 6
If we lay 5 shirts out in the sun and it takes 4 hours to dry, how long would 20 shirts take to dry? Explain your reasoning step by step.
### Expected Answer
4 hours
### Received Answer
**Step 1: Determine the drying time ratio.**

- If 5 shirts take 4 hours to dry, then each shirt takes 4/5 of the drying time.

**Step 2: Multiply the drying time ratio by the number of shirts.**

- To dry 20 shirts, each shirt will take 4/5 of the drying time, which is 4/5 * 20 = 16 hours.

Therefore, it would take a total of 16 hours to dry 20 shirts in the sun, assuming that the drying time is proportional to the number of shirts.

### Summarizing 1
What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?
One of the first complaints presented to doctors by many people later diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face. You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses. There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling" movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor. Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous. These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a "festinating gait," and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down. Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD.
### Expected Answer
Involuntary tremors, slowed movements, and posture and balance issues are common early symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, often accompanied by disturbances in voluntary movements, speech, mood, and gastrointestinal issues as the disease progresses.
### Received Answer
Sure, here is a one-sentence summary of the article:

Parkinson's Disease commonly causes involuntary tremors, slowed movements, postural rigidity, and speech disturbances, which are often the first signs of the disease.

### Summarizing 3
News article: Amy Winehouse has finally released a new single: A cover of Lesley Gore's 1963 hit "It's My Party" for the Quincy Jones tribute album Q: Soul Bossa Nostra. Our expectations for Amy's upcoming album of "jukebox stuff" have been raised. ||||| When it was announced that the first bit of music the world would hear from Amy Winehouse after all that tabloid trouble would be a cover of Lesley Gore's "It's My Party” for a Quincy Jones tribute album, Vulture found it just a touch uninspiring. But now the cover is actually here, and it's tough not to get carried away. Winehouse lets it fly on the Mark Ronson–produced do-over — turning in a dialed-in, muscular vocal performance that moves effortlessly from louche to anguished — and sounds not even a tiny bit horribly addicted to drugs while doing so. No word on an official Back to Black follow-up or anything, of course, but there is one other potentially positive sign: Winehouse has gone from tweeting stuff like “ronson you're dead to me; one album i write an you take half the credit — make a career out of it? don't think so BRUV” to things like “can't find me bleedin notebooks — theyve done a runsies xxxxxxxx LOVE YOU RONSON XXXXXXxxxxxxxxx.” ||||| Image Credit: Samir Hussein/Getty ImagesIf there’s something we know our beloved little wayward beehive enjoys, it’s a good party. And apparently, this one ends in tears. The 27-year-old Grammy winner returned to the studio recently for the star-strewn Quincy Jones release Q: Soul Bossa Nostra, due November 9, with her Back to Black producer (and recent subject of a Wino tweet-spanking) Mark Ronson. You can hear their recording of Lesley Gore’s 1963 teenage cri de coeur “It’s My Party” over at NYmag.com (via Soundcloud). The RonHouse pairing proves as Spector-esquely fruitful as ever—though frankly, whether the reasons are stylistic or substance-related, Amy’s penchant for slurring her vocals yields something closer to “Ish My Parrry.” What do you think? Tell us in the comments section below. (Follow The Music Mix on Twitter: @EWMusicMix.) More on Amy Winehouse: Amy Winehouse to Mark Ronson: ‘You’re dead to me’ Amy Winehouse to sing ‘It’s My Party’ for Quincy Jones ||||| In April we reported that Amy Winehouse and Mark Ronson were working together again, on three tracks for a Quincy Jones tribute album. Well, this is apparently a leaked version of one of their tracks, a cover of It's My Party (Jones's first big hit when he produced the Lesley Gore original in 1963). It's not – how can we say this? – the most coherent vocal ever laid to tape, although if there's ever a song where you can let it all go a bit runny-mascara-and-10-Bacardi-Breezers then this is it. Having said that, if you really wanted to hear the original sung in this style you could just stagger into any random hen night at 3am, right?
What is a shorter version of the above article?
### Expected Answer
Amy Winehouse, a famous singer, has released a new song called "It's My Party." This song is her version of an older song from 1963 by Lesley Gore. She worked with another music person, Mark Ronson, to make this. People are excited to hear more new music from Amy Winehouse after she had some trouble in her life.
### Received Answer
Sure, here is a shorter version of the article:

Amy Winehouse has released a new single, a cover of Lesley Gore's 1963 hit "It's My Party." The cover is part of the Quincy Jones tribute album Q: Soul Bossa Nostra.

Winehouse's performance is muscular and louche, and it's tough not to get carried away by her passionate vocals. The song is a good party song, and it's also a song about heartbreak and tears.

There is no official word on an upcoming Back to Black follow-up, but there is one other potentially positive sign: Winehouse has gone from tweeting stuff like "ronson you're dead to me; one album i write an you take half the credit — make a career out of it? don't think so BRUV" to things like "can't find me bleedin notebooks — they've done a runsies xxxxxxxx LOVE YOU RONSON XXXXXXxxxxxxxxx."

Summarize the following into one sentence: "Lithium is a metal that does not readily dissolve in most solvents. However, it can be dissolved in some organic solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and diglyme. These solvents have a high polarity and a relatively low boiling point, which allows them to dissolve lithium salts and other compounds containing lithium. Other solvents that can dissolve lithium include acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and water. It should be noted that the solubility of lithium in these solvents depends on various factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of other compounds."
