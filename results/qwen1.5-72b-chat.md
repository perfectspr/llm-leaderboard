### Knowledge 1
Towards which part of a man's body does a tie hang if he is performing a handstand?
### Expected Answer
Towards his head
### Received Answer
If a man is performing a handstand, his tie would hang towards his feet or the opposite direction from his head. In a normal standing position, the tie hangs down from the collar of the shirt towards the lower half of the body. In an inverted position like a handstand, the tie would follow the inverse trajectory, hanging towards the feet.

### Knowledge 2
Who was the president in 2003 and why?
### Expected Answer
In 2003, the President of the United States was George W. Bush. He was the 43rd President, serving from January 20, 2001, to January 20, 2009. George W. Bush was elected President in the 2000 election, having previously served as the Governor of Texas. He was then re-elected in the 2004 election for a second term.

The reason why George W. Bush was president in 2003 is simply that he won the 2000 presidential election, securing the majority of electoral votes against his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, in a highly contested election that included a significant dispute over the vote count in Florida. After a series of court challenges, the United States Supreme Court effectively halted the recount in Florida, resulting in Bush winning the state's electoral votes and thus the presidency. Bush was inaugurated as President on January 20, 2001, and served during 2003 as part of his first term in office.
### Received Answer
The president of the United States in 2003 was George W. Bush. He was serving his second term in office, having been re-elected in 2004. In 2003, Bush's administration was primarily focused on the War in Iraq, which had begun in March 2003.

### Knowledge 3
Why can camels survive for long without water?
### Expected Answer
Camels use the fat in their humps to keep them filled with energy and hydration for long periods of time.
### Received Answer
Camels are adapted to survive in the harsh desert environments where they typically live. They have several adaptations that allow them to go long periods without water:

1. Water storage: Camels have the ability to store large amounts of water in their bodies, particularly in their bloodstream and in their tissues.

2. Efficient water use: Camels have an efficient way of processing and conserving water. Their kidneys are adapted to reabsorb more water during urination.

3. High tolerance to dehydration: Camels have a higher tolerance to dehydration compared to other mammals. They can lose up to 35% of their body weight in water before it becomes life-threatening.

4. Adapted diet: Camels' diet is adapted to the desert environment. They primarily feed on thorny desert plants, which have low water content but high roughage.

These adaptations enable camels to survive in the harsh desert conditions with limited access to water.
